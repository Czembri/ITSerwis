###### Setup warnings

1. If you want to receive logs default path for itserwis.log file is [LogFilePath](D:/Temp/Itserwis/Log)
2. For correctly working ShortServiceDocument class you need to move **generate_pdf.py** file to location: [PythonFile](D:/Temp/Itserwis/Log)
3. Also I haven't still refined connection with python script, so you need to install manualy (via using pip):
